### High Altitude Balloon Autonomous Altitude Control System
**[Project Page](https://brickworks.github.io/Nucleus/pdr_altitudecontrol/)**  
**Personal, 2020**  
Designed a control system for a high altitude balloon (HAB) to maintain a target altitude by venting gas from the balloon and dropping ballast mass in flight. Modeled passive flight dynamics of a HAB in MATLAB, Simulink, and Python. Developed a state machine and control system in Simulink and used the model to tune a PID controller. Derived a state-space model, Kalman filter, and LQR controller from scratch to achieve better performance.
