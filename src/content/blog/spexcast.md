I produced, edited, and co-hosted a podcast and blog about the science and technology of space exploration.

Together with my friend [TJ Tarazevits](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjtarazevits/), we created 90 [audio podcast uploads](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/spexcast/id1089397071) and 60+ [written blog posts](https://blog.spexcast.com/tag/articles/).

From 2016 (!!!) to 2021, TJ and I brought on space industry professionals to talk about their projects, and collaborated with other co-hosts [Faris Hamdi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fhamdi/), [Drew Walters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-walters-4455127a/), and [Augie Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/august-allen-a8239841/).
