### On-Orbit Demonstrations of Proactive Tasking of Glint Imagery
**IEEE Aerospace Conference, 2023**  
*Awarded Best Paper in Track (Track 12)* [doi:10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115608](https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO55745.2023.10115608)  
Formalized a methodology to predict future glint windows over a specific region. Studied various tasking approaches that described the satellite's actions during these windows to autonomously acquire glint captures. These actions were then demonstrated by orbiting satellites, and their captures were then analyzed.
