**Graduate Paper, 2017**

Contributed to a proposal for a Probe Class (~\$850M) NASA mission for a 1.5 meter space telescope intended to observe near-infrared light from the early universe. Compiled financial, mass, and power budgets for the optics, instruments, cryocooler & spacecraft. Defined system-level design, generated representative CAD models and figures of the spacecraft. This mission was published in the NASA 2020 Decadal Survey. My contribution: [GitHub: runphilrun/CDIM-design](https://github.com/runphilrun/CDIM-design)
