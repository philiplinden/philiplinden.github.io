**Small Satellite Conference, 2021**

Developed and executed an on-orbit calibration campaign. Automated on-orbit procedures and analyses were used for calibration and validation of an optical image stabilization (OIS) system across a fleet of 19 satellites. OIS actuation settings were configured for each image capture through automated optimization procedures.
