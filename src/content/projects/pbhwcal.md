### Automatic Optical Image Stabilization System Calibration
**[SSC21-VIII-05](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2021/all2021/189/)**  
**Small Satellite Conference, 2021**  
Developed and executed an on-orbit calibration campaign. Automated on-orbit procedures and analyses were used for calibration and validation of an optical image stabilization (OIS) system across a fleet of 19 satellites. OIS actuation settings were configured for each image capture through automated optimization procedures.
