This project aims to use agent-based modeling and simulations to explore how network topology and time synchronization evolve in a growing lunar ecosystem. Modeling how the approach may be used in practice and at scale informs decisions about how to architect a robust cislunar PNT system that scales with the population.

I'm especially proud of some "learn with me" articles I wrote on this topic, like this [walkthrough of time dilation calculations](https://philiplinden.github.io/spacetime/notebooks/time_dilation.html).
